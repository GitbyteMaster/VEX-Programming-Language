*What is VEX?*

VEX is a Batch programming language using multiple line based functions, meaning that no 
function will take one line only. Though this uses more bytes, this makes building and   modding easier. It has open Batch script within its console, and can use some Batch 
refrences. (VPL Docs: Batch Adaptation)
